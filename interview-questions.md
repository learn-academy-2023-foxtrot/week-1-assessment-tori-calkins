# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is the local console in which you type your information on. The difference between git and Github is Github is the storer of the remote console, this is where you push/merge whats on your local branches to the remote repository.

Researched answer: Git is a free version control system that is not directed to a specific language or operating system. Github is website that allows developers to store and share code. The difference between git and Github is Github is the online website used by developers to be able to use the git technology meanwhile git is its own technology. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: There are three main types of JavaScript operators equality, relational, and logical operators within are strict and loose equality operators and logical AND and logical OR operators. These operators all will return a boolean value. 

Researched answer: JavaScipt has multiple operators that are used to execute a Boolean value. The three main categories of: equality, relational, and logical. For equality there is loose operators which use == and strict operators which use ===. For logical there is logical AND which use &&, logical OR which use ||, and lastly negation which uses !. All used for different purposes, but return you with a Boolean value if needed.

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array's index counts the amounts of values inside of an array starting at 0 and going up from there. An array's value(s) are located inside of braces.

Researched answer: An array's index puts a numbered location to each value/element, starting at 0 and going up from there,  which allows the ability to address each individual element separately or together. The values are separate elements inside of brackets, in the form of JavaScript data types, that are held in one variable. Each element can be a different data type as long as they are used correctly and can be read by the computer. 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: An array holds sets of values/elements within braces. Strings are a type of JavaScript datatype that is used to execute letters and words within quotations. Arrays can hold strings as their values, just like how a string can hold letters/values inside of its quotations. Both hold values within themselves and a specific format.

Researched answer: Although, arrays and strings are different and used for different goals, their structures are similar. Arrays hold collections of data inside of a memory location and strings are one of the types of data that can be stored inside of the memory location. An array generally holds multiple elements of the same datatype within itself, meanwhile a string hold one value and separates itself with quotation marks. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming is the process of two individual people working together on one repository to complete a goal. There is one person who is the designated driver and another person who is the navigator for the driver. The driver's duty is to have their screen shared, showing their code and terminal, along with their hands being on the keyboard typing. The navigator's job is to have the instruction/directions visible to themselves to verbally express to the driver what needs to be typed, fixed, or run in order to get to the correct destination/goal without touching their own keyboard.

Researched answer: The driver is the one with their hands on the keyboard, typing the information and instructions given by the navigator. The navigator is responsible for verbally communicating what needs to be done to the driver. This practice is best used when the roles are flipped every 10-20 minutes to expand both communicating skills about specific topics/vocabulary and hands on skills.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Built-in methood of JavaScript that alter functions to be arguments that are used on arrays to excute the argument on each value in the array. 

2. Jest: is a JavaScript test framework used to assure the correctness of a codebase in JavaScript. It is multiple files of code/dependencies used together to make tests on code availiable.

3. Objects: a collection of key value pairs inside of braces. The value pair should consist of a datatype of symbol and any value thats within a set datatype, for best use.
