1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array's index counts the amounts of values inside of an array starting at 0 and going up from there. An array's value(s) are located inside of brackets.

Researched answer: An array's index puts a numbered location to each value/element, starting at 0 and going up from there,  which allows the ability to address each individual element separately or together. The values are separate elements inside of brackets, in the form of JavaScript data types, that are held in one variable. Each element can be a different data type as long as they are used correctly and can be read by the computer.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming is the process of two individual people working together on one repository to complete a goal. There is one person who is the designated driver and another person who is the navigator for the driver. The driver's duty is to have their screen shared, showing their code and terminal, along with their hands being on the keyboard typing. The navigator's job is to have the instruction/directions visible to themselves to verbally express to the driver what needs to be typed, fixed, or run in order to get to the correct destination/goal without touching their own keyboard.

Researched answer: The driver is the one with their hands on the keyboard, typing the information and instructions given by the navigator. The navigator is responsible for verbally communicating what needs to be done to the driver. This practice is best used when the roles are flipped every 10-20 minutes to expand both communicating skills about specific topics/vocabulary and hands on skills.
